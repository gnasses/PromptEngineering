To use this pattern, your prompt should make the following fundamental contextual statements: 
- I would like to achieve X  
- I know that I need to perform steps A,B,C 
- Provide a complete sequence of steps for me 
- Fill in any missing steps 
- (Optional) Identify any unnecessary steps 
You will need to replace "X" with an appropriate task. 
You will then need to specify the steps A, B, C that you know need to be part of the recipe / complete plan. 
 
 
Example: I would like to configure BGP on an internet edge router. 
I know that I need to perform configuration steps on the ISP-facing interface, then BGP routing configuration steps on the router, then need to turn up the interface to the ISP and verify routing. 
Provide a complete sequence of steps for me. Fill in any missing steps.
