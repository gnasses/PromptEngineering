To use this pattern, your prompt should make the following fundamental contextual statements: 
 
At the end, repeat Y and/or ask me for X.  
(You will need to replace "Y" with what the model should repeat, such as "repeat my list of options", and X with what it should ask for, "for the next action".)
These statements usually need to be at the end of the prompt or next to last. 
 
Examples:
