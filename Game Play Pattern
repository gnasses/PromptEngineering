Create a Game or Simulation tailored to a specific scenario or expertise 
  
•Describe in as much detail as possible 
•Use Specific tasks and requests 
•Ask for additional feedback or input 

Example:
Create a Network Engineering game which is based on the persona of a Network Engineer trying to solve performance problems through troubleshooting.
You will describe the scenario the engineer faces and ask a question about troubleshooting the scenario. 
Scanarios should be based on real-world network problems within a hospital system. 
After I provide an answer, you will grade that answer on a scale of A (best) to F (completely wrong), then provide suggestions on possible better approaches that could have been chosen.
