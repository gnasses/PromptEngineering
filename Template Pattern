Example 1:

Configuration Elements 

Please create configuration for interfaces own my switch. Ask me for the port number, description, and vlan number separated by commas. 
You will fit that into this template in the placeholder sections bracket by <> and print the output. 
Once you have completed an interface configuration, wait for another input. 
Merge output from the next configuration into what you have already outputted as another configuration entry but keeping the ports in order. 
Here is the template:  
  interface Ethernet<port>  
     description <description>  
     switchport switchport access vlan <vlan>  
    spanning-tree bpduguard disable  
     no shutdown   

Here is a list of ports to put in to start:  
  1/7, MN-DEV-1, 4000 
  1/1, uplink, 100  
  1/20, MN-WEB-2, 2003  
  1/3, MN-SQLDB-4, 2001  
  1/5, MN-APP-3, 2002  
  1/2, MN-FW-1, 200  

Example 2:
 
Programmability Constructs (JSON/XML/YAML) 

Take this output from a device, and create entries based on the following template:

{  
"type" : "ethernet", 
"if-name" : "gigabitEthernet1", 
"description" : "outside ", 
"ip-address" : "172.15.15.16", 
"subnet-mask" : "255.255.254.0", 
"nat-direction" : "outside”, 
"icmp-redirects" : true, 
"icmp-unreachable" : true, 
"proxy-arp" : true, 
"verify-unicast-source" : true 
 }
